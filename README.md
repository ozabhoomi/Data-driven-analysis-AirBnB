📊 Data-Driven Analysis of Airbnb Listings Across the U.S. West Coast        ||                                                               October – December 2025


🔍 Project Overview


This project delivers a large-scale, multi-city analysis of 66,000+ Airbnb listings across five major U.S. West Coast markets—Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland. Acting as a data consultant, the analysis applies data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and analytical storytelling to identify the key drivers of revenue, occupancy, and guest satisfaction.

The objective is to translate complex marketplace data into actionable, strategy-driven insights that Airbnb and hosts can use to optimize pricing, improve host performance, and increase booking efficiency.

🎯 Central Research Question

How can Airbnb leverage insights from pricing, host behavior, reviews, and amenities to increase revenue, improve guest satisfaction, and boost booking conversions across West Coast markets?

🧠 Analytical Focus Areas

Revenue & pricing dynamics

Host responsiveness & Superhost impact

Review quality, volume, and satisfaction

Amenity differentiation & occupancy

City-specific market behavior

🗂️ Dataset Overview

Total Listings Analyzed: 66,000+

Markets: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland

Unit of Analysis: Individual Airbnb listing

Each dataset contains approximately 78 features, including:

Host attributes (response rate, acceptance rate, Superhost status)

Pricing, availability, and estimated revenue

Review scores (cleanliness, communication, value, location)

Amenities and property characteristics

Occupancy and booking proxies

🧪 Hypothesis-Driven Methodology

This project is grounded in formal hypothesis testing to ensure findings are statistically meaningful and business-relevant.

Key Hypotheses Tested

Superhost Effect: Listings managed by Superhosts generate a disproportionately higher share of total revenue relative to their share of listings.

Responsiveness Effect: Higher host response rates are associated with increased revenue and occupancy.

Amenity Effect: Listings with more and higher-quality amenities achieve higher review scores and occupancy.

Market Heterogeneity: Guest preferences and revenue drivers vary significantly by city.

Multiple null hypotheses were rejected, demonstrating that host behavior, responsiveness, amenities, and location materially influence financial outcomes.

📈 Key Findings
1️⃣ Host Responsiveness Drives Revenue

Hosts who respond 99–100% of the time consistently earn higher average revenue

The strongest responsiveness-to-revenue relationship appears in San Diego and Seattle

2️⃣ Superhost Status Is a Revenue Multiplier

Across all markets, Superhosts significantly outperform non-Superhosts

Revenue premiums are most pronounced in San Diego and Seattle

3️⃣ City-Specific Market Patterns

San Diego exhibits the highest estimated annual revenue and pricing power

Portland shows the highest concentration of Superhosts

Review volume shows a weak relationship with price, suggesting quality outweighs quantity

🧭 Strategic Recommendations
For Hosts

Maintain near-perfect response rates

Prioritize achieving Superhost status

Invest in cleanliness and communication, the strongest review drivers

Consider high-performing markets such as San Diego and Seattle

For Airbnb

Introduce incentive structures tied to responsiveness and Superhost performance

Provide city-specific pricing guidance to reduce underpricing and volatility

Promote amenity bundles linked to higher occupancy and satisfaction
